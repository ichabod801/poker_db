### Rules:
1. Deal seven cards face down to each player.
2. Deal one card face up to the table.
3. Discard any cards with the same rank as a table card. If you have no cards you must fold. If you still have card you must reante.
4. Repeat the last two actions until zero or one players are left. If one player is left, they get the pot. If no players are left, all who were in before the last table card split the pot.
